Implement Hill Cipher Using Sage.  
The goal of this homework is to implement Hill Cipher using Sage. Sage is a powerful mathematic software which can compute matrix determinants and inverses. So, you do not need to implement those functions yourselves. However, your program must be able to do the following:
1) Read the key from a text file. The key can be a square matrix of any dimension (nxn), but it has to be at least 3x3.  
2) Read a text file, encrypt its content, and save the result in another file.  
3) Restore the cipher text file back to plaintext.  
4) You may assume that the plaintext message consists of English letters only.
